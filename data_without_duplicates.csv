0,5,I do not recommend this,2,Lisa N,1.0,"Wij hadden de rondvaart met luxe salonboot geboekt tijdens het Amsterdam Light Festval. We hebben niks kunnen zien omdat de hele weg de ramen zo beslagen waren dat je echt niks kon zien. In het voorste deel van de boot kon je wel naar buiten kijken want dit was glas, maar het achterste deel waar wij zaten hadden ze afgesloten met plastic waardoor je echt niks meekreeg van buiten. Ze hadden ons trekkers gegeven om de condens zelf de hele tijd weg te werken maar het was bijna tegelijkertijd weer terug. Daarnaast zit je er niet echt op te wachten om de hele rit de ramen te lappen. 

Ook zouden we uitleg krijgen over de kunstwerken die we onderweg zouden zien. Echter hebben we bij misschien vier van de tientallen werken een uitleg gekregen. Bij de rest van de kunstwerken werd niks gezegd of werd je niet eens geattendeerd dat we er langsgingen. 

Tenslotte stond er op internet dat het 75 min zou duren. We waren zeker binnen één uur al weer terug, omdat we ook nog eens later waren vertrokken. Dat is niet erg, maar vermeld dan niet dat het 75 min duurt.

Al met al viel het dus ontzettend tegen... Niet aan te raden.

1,38,Total Waste of an Hour and Money,1,Jennifer B,1.0,"Total waste of money.  Cruise started 15 minutes late, and was crammed full of people so we sat shoulder to shoulder with strangers.  Got a small plastic glass of very cheap wine and gouda cheese cubes - AND had to balance all of it on my lap.  Tour guides gave NO info - just jokes. We couldn't even enjoy the view since the windows were covered in plastic rather than glass.   Glad I had gone on a ""real"" canal cruise earlier in the week that was informative.  We were so disappointed.  Expected a variety of cheeses since the Netherlands are known for them and wanted to sit around a table with my family for a relaxed evening tour.  $150 down the drain (and they requested a tip on top of that!!)

Would love to have that money back.   Took the tour on November 24th, 2023.",2023-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,2023-11-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Hi there,

7,155,Waste of time,2,Vivian B,1.0,"We did not enjoy this experience at all!   First, because of our schedule,  we had to go on a night cruise.  Most of the tour boats we had seen on the canals had glass windows and glass roofs,  these boats do not.  Therefor the visibility was very poor.  We had expected a glass roof like the others that would have allowed us to see.  Second,  the boat was late.  A man came to the meeting point and said they decided to leave from a different canal so the group had to walk to the new meeting place without much explanation.  Once at the new meeting place,  in spite of the fact it was past our scheduled departure time,  they kept the passengers waiting out in the cold, watching while a crew member slowly finished her dinner in the boat.  Third, we finally left about 15 minutes or so late.  A few guests were loud and obnoxious and made it difficult for us to hear anything the crew was saying about the city or anything else for that matter.  Overall was a complete waste of our evening.  Perhaps under different circumstances it would have been better but I do not recommend this tour to anyone. ",2023-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,2023-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s:

8,36,"Bossy guide, couldn’t see, boring commentary and the boat crashed!!",2,Nashes_5,169.0,"Very average. The commentary was banal, immature, and focused on how much the houses cost and how much she wanted a sugar daddy (which some punters found funny) and included very little of interest. No real history of Amsterdam or its canals. I’m sure tourists can be annoying but I got told off in no uncertain terms for opening the plastic windows at the back of the boat because I couldn’t see properly. She insisted the is would make it too cold. Ok so then we were sat at the back and couldn’t see!! So an hour of no views, in the dark listening to irritating commentary.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us, and we sincerely apologize for the disappointment you faced during your recent canal tour. Your feedback is valuable, and we take it seriously as we strive to provide an enjoyable and informative experience for all our guests.

11,487,Don’t waste your money,1,Scorpio80WestLondon,1.0,"The trip was not cheap and I was disappointed at what the trip entailed:
  
we were advised that the boat was leaving outside the Anne Frank Museum however this was incorrect as we stood outside and then were told that we needed to be at the next canal. I only found this out as I asked the assistant that was there a few mins before the trip as the boat had not arrived.
 
As we had to run over to the other side, we ended up being at the end of the queue and when we went onto the boat, we were not even sitting at the table, therefore we could not reach the cheese and wine on the table

The boat  was over overcrowded and the workers on the boat also stated that the boat was overcrowded and there was no organisation as those who had not opted for the cheese and wine were sitting at the table. We asked if we could swap but this was turned down.

The photos on the advert show that you would have a table for your party and include crackers with the cheese and that it was unlimited. That was not the case as there were no crackers and we could not get to the cheeseboards as the boat was so crowded, so we did not have much at all.

The organisers seemed primarily focused on and fully attentive to those who had paid for cheese and drinks, with the goal of maximising liquor sales.

I hope this message finds you well. I felt compelled to share my recent experience with Flagship Amsterdam, as it regrettably fell short of expectations.

The Google Maps directions provided proved inaccurate, causing initial confusion. Upon arrival, we discovered our booked slot was overbooked, resulting in a two-hour delay. Unfortunately, a similar situation unfolded with the subsequent boat, leading to further delays as the skipper and frustrated passengers sought a resolution.

Given the circumstances, we would like to offer you a solution that we hope will relieve some of the frustration you've experienced. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we are committed to finding a way to make this experience right for you. Please reach out to us at customersupport@flagshipamsterdam.com to discuss the best way forward for you. We genuinely appreciate your understanding.

19,443,Find Another Company,2,Alec D,3.0,"Time on tickets and all confirmation emails was incorrect, which meant we arrived 45 minutes early to an empty dock in the pouring rain and had to wait until the previous tour ended to ask what was going on. The crew offered no apologies, just that we were “the second person today to have that issue.” Additionally, it took us 20 minutes and directions from 3 other more clearly advertised boat tour companies to locate the ‘flagship Amsterdam’ dock. Multiple other visitors on our tour also noted the same issue when they got on board. As mentioned earlier, it was raining for the tour and the entire back half of the boat had plastic sheeting windows that fogged up making it impossible to see anything during the tour. The tour guide noted that the ‘normally have a cleaning solution for the fog on these windows but couldn’t find it for this tour.” The tour itself would have been fun and informative if not for all the above. There are multiple other companies running the same ‘cheese and wine’ tour that appear to be far more professional, so just look for another company.

Thank you for your valuable feedback. We're glad to hear you found the cruise and guide information satisfactory. However, we're sorry to learn about the inconvenience caused by the separate drink and cheese package. 

I have looked into your booking, and you were in fact on a separate boat until the rain disrupted planning and we had to put you on a weather-appropriate boat which then resulted in the combined booking. This happens often, especially in the winter. 

Typically we give our customers the option to upgrade to a Cheese and Wine option at an added value of 10 euros per person, as this elevates the experience. But I understand that if you are not up for the complimentary culinary experience, it's worth getting a heads-up about it anyway. 

This we completely understand and we will look into communicating this better to our customers who have not signed up for the cheese and wine tour. 

Your feedback has been insightful and an opportunity to improve our service - thank you!

Thank you for your response. I want to personally apologize for any discomfort or frustration this may have caused you. It is certainly not our intention to make any guest feel excluded or not part of the group.

I understand that you had booked an Open Boat canal cruise with the option to purchase drinks at the bar, but you were unexpectedly placed with the wine/beer and cheese tour group, and as a result, you did not have access to wine and cheese.

Typically,  in cases where adverse weather conditions or technical issues significantly impact an Open Boat Tour, we offer an upgrade to our guests, providing them with a more luxurious (and dry) experience on our Saloon boat, which also includes an optional selection of cheese and wine.

You were supposed to be presented with the opportunity to either upgrade your ticket for a nominal fee of 10 euros, allowing you to enjoy the unlimited cheese and wine experience, or to purchase both wine and non-alcoholic beverages during your tour. We deeply regret this oversight on our part and extend our sincerest apologies for the unnecessary inconvenience you encountered.

We understand that this situation fell short of our usual standards of service and want to rectify it. As a follow-up to this matter, we kindly request that you contact us so we can discuss potential solutions and make amends for the inconvenience you experienced. We value your feedback and are committed to ensuring your future experiences with us are exceptional.

The cheese: 1 small cheese board between 4 of us when considering the cost of the trip I felt this was really stingy. From what I could tell there were 2 cheeses but no idea what these were as no description given. I was kinda expecting a bit of info on what we were eating.
The drinks: to be fair, this did seem to be quite free flowing. We opted for the wine. I tried the chardonnay and the rose they were OK. My husband liked them more than I did.
The boat; clean and tidy but not decorated like the photos, it was over crowded, we all had a seat but rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to me is not my idea of a luxury cruise.
The tour and staff: really friendly and our host did tell us some good facts but was expecting a bit more. He didn't start until everyone had got a drink which on the one hand is nice but when that takes 15mins that's alot if time missed talking about the stuff around.

37,698,Not what we expected ,3,cocobch,107.0,"We were a little disappointed to be honest. The tour guides were very nice and knowledgeable; however, the (clearly solicited) rave reviews and pictured  board on tablecloth with fluffy-pillowed seats had our expectations very high. Upon boarding, we slid into our un-pillowed seats and were served nibbles of cheese with a glass of wine or can of beer. These were refilled upon request. On the plus side, the one guide gave a very interesting talk about the history of both Amsterdam and the canals as a whole. But at least during our tour, the Anne Frank house was never mentioned. If we passed it (as advertised), it was never discussed. They pointed out the Ritz Carlton and told us how much it cost to stay there and then they said we’d be back to our dock in 10 minutes. We enjoyed the tour for a fun diversion. But when we got off the boat, we looked at each other and said we should get on another tour boat that just had forward-facing seats and a canned talk so all the highlights could be pointed out for tourists who need the orientation.

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us as it helps us identify areas for improvement, and we take your concerns seriously. It is clear that we fell short of meeting your expectations in your experience, and for that, I am truly sorry.

We apologize for any disappointment caused. As a boat tour company, it's our priority to provide enjoyable and memorable experiences for our customers. It saddens us to learn that we fell short of delivering the information you hoped for about our beautiful city.

We will make sure to address both topics with our team to ensure that our customers can fully enjoy our future tours.

40,519,A nice cruise with some hiccups,4,Elisa K,2.0,"The canal cruise itself was lovely, we saw Amsterdam from a new point of view and learned some interesting facts about the city from the two friendly and professional guides. The wines were also good and the atmosphere was nice. However there were some hiccups in our personal experience. At the start we almost missed the whole ride, because the location they gave for pick-up lead us to the wrong side of the canal the boat departed from. Calling their assistance center helped and we got to the boat running on the last minute, but it may be worth putting the correct coordinates on Google Maps for example. There are so many different boat tours leaving from the Central Station that it took us half an hour before we eventually got to the right one.

Because of this we were seated right at the back of the boat which we didn’t mind otherwise, but it was pretty difficult to hear the guides who stood only at the front and had to shout over the engine sounds. Maybe they could move around in the boat a little, or get a microphone to help with the audio? It was also a little hard getting the things we were asking for, for example when we asked for a refill of the cheese plate (that was unlimited and everyone else had already gotten one) we never got it.

The guides didn’t really come to the back, and pretty much only the people in the front could ask questions. I understand it’s hard moving in the boat, but I maybe expected the overall boat tour being about them telling us about Amsterdam, not mostly answering some individual questions we couldn’t hear at all. But this is also on us, we could’ve chosen a tour that gives more information about the city.",2023-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,2023-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Dec 2023-20240113T072004Z-001.zip,04 Dec 2023.xlsx,2023-11,[],3.0,Amsterdam Luxury Boat Canal Cruise - Rijkmuseum,False,1669,Neutral,Need to Respond

Mostly it was factoids and jokes, which was enjoyable enough. Try to sit toward the middle of the boat instead of the back. At the back of the boat, where the engines are, we could barely hear what the guide was saying, and they didn’t use the audio system although there were speakers mounted all around.

482,161,"Joy, Knowledge, and Exceptional Value. ",5,GordonCenter,14.0,"Full disclosure, my wife booked the cruise because the boats looked prettier than all the other boats - so even though this company is a little newer, and isn't quite as well known as the other companies, their selection of wooden boats appealed to my wife's aesthetic instincts. Boy, and I glad I listened to her (and shouldn't we be doing that with most everything in our lives?). The cruise started at the Central Train Station, and was a little over an hour. Our guides were Sergey and Ibrahim, and they were funny, entertaining, and interesting. Our family had a great time reviewing the trip later over dinner, and as we walked back to our hotel we recognized several landmarks that had been pointed out to us on the cruise. There was a great atmosphere on the boat, and everyone was laughing and it all felt very relaxed. Both Sergey and Ibrahim did a great job of fielding questions from the passengers, and afterwards a dozen of us who had just met found ourselves standing on the dock after the cruise discussing our visits to Amsterdam. Thank you to Captain Jay for his skillful piloting of an all electric boat. We did the wine and cheese version, and it was a great value.

738,738,Very bad canal tour cruise but Tumelo was very helpful & friendly. I would not recommend this tour.,1,Paul G,2.0,"As per their TripAdvisor page, this is an "" interactive tour"" with ""a small group of people"".... It wasn't an interactive tour, nor was it with a small group of people - It was full of really loud Americans (about 20 of them). From their page, I got the impression that this was going to be a nice & relaxing evening canal cruise, which it wasn't - about 5% of the tour was ""interactive"" and about 95% of the tour was the tour guides talking to fellow event-goers about things that were unrelated to the tour, and talking really loudly. We passed by some lovely buildings that I was interested to know more about but the tour guides didn't talk about 95% of all landmarks that we passed by, and landmarks that I asked for information on, they weren't able to answer my questions. The only highlight of the tour was Tumelo, who was one of the tour guides and she was lovely, very helpful.",,2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Hi Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent canal tour experience. We sincerely apologize for falling short of your expectations and for any inconvenience you experienced during the tour.

Your comments are invaluable to us, and we're truly sorry that the tour did not align with the expectations set by our TripAdvisor page. We understand that you anticipated a more interactive and relaxing tour with a smaller group, and we regret that the reality was different.

I can imagine that the loud guests disrupted your enjoyment and the overall experience of the tour. We will address these issues with our guides to ensure a more suitable and enjoyable experience for all guests. We also apologize for not providing comprehensive information about the landmarks during the tour, and we will work on enhancing the educational aspect of our tours.

We appreciate your kind words about one of our tour guides. We will ensure your feedback reaches her as well.

They knew a lot about the city and were very happy to answer questions. The tour passed by so quick while having a chat with them and looking around that I didn't realise that an hour has passed. They also suggested places to eat and have drinks at. Because I took the tour on a Monday, it ended up only 3 of us on the boat, which made the experience even more personalised. I have taken canal tours and boat tours in other cities as well, but this one was truly different in a great way.

799,799,A Pleasant Canal Cruise Experience,4,Ms_H64,72.0,"Took this cruise immediately after touring the Anne Frank Huis as it is directly across from the museum. We were over half an hour early for our tour but since the boat wasn't full they allowed us to join them on the earlier tour, which worked out well since right at the end it began to pour. Because it was a rainy day, everything was a bit slippery but the guys helped us safely climb into the boat. Please note that there is no pier, dock, etc. for these boats, so be prepared with comfortable shoes and clothes; if you are handicapped this probably isn't the tour for you. This was an open boat, so we were exposed to the elements. They had large umbrellas and blankets on board if we wanted to use them. They advertise a ""bar"", but it was basically a bench with a bunch of booze bottles on it and glasses, etc. You are not obligated to buy anything, though. Everything was in English and the guides were entertaining and interesting. One hour was just the right amount of time to get a nice overview of the canals and some history of Amsterdam. If I went again, I would choose a closed boat tour. This group claimed they could cover the boats but I'm not sure these particular boats get covered. (Note that you can pick up other tour boats elsewhere in the city, like the area closer to Centraal Station, which might have piers/docks.) Other than that, worth the trip on a good-weather day.",2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Dec 2023-20240113T072004Z-001.zip,04 Dec 2023.xlsx,2023-10,[],4.0,Amsterdam Luxury Boat Canal Cruise - Anne Frank House,False,1396,Positive,Response Not Needed

838,838,"A really great tour, even in the rain",5,Kellie,2.0,"We booked the tour for my friend's birthday, and were a little disappointed when the weather was grey and rainy the day the tour came around. As it was meant to be an open-air boat, we were worried that we'd end up getting drenched. However the boat had been fitted with rain covers that, although they made it harder to see the views around us, kept us comfortable and dry. 
The very front of the boat wasn't covered up to ensure that we still had a good view of what was head of us, and we were allowed to slightly unzip and look out of the covers on the sides of the boat if we wanted a better view. 
Erin was our captain and host (she explained that the host had called in sick so she would be performing both roles) and she really made the tour fantastic. We still got to see some great sights even through the rain covers, and Erin kept us entertained with stories about the history of Amsterdam and the Netherlands. There are complementary blankets on board to stop you getting cold, and Erin gave my friend a free glass of wine for her birthday. We really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend Flagship!

839,839,Great Experience Overshadowed ,2,Anna H,1.0,I went recently with a group of my girl friends. On first thought we saw a beautiful boat and great wine and cheese. The entire tour was absolutely gorgeous and great accommodations. I would have left a 4 star review if it wasn’t for a specific worker. Our female tour guide and server and was rude to solely my friends and I over the microphone.  We were five 21 year old girls who were there for the tour and paid for the unlimited beverages. Not only did she ignore us when we asked for our beverages but she also refused to acknowledge us except for when we were talking about how to get our drinks during her speaking tour. We paid an extra 15 euros for the unlimited service and was almost denied it and screamed at publicly for taking our own drinks. I want to stress that I would recommend this tour but not the service from this particular woman. I am thoroughly disappointed and feel as if I was scammed out of my money. ,2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Dear customer,

928,928,Absolutely brilliant! ,5,Joy W,20.0,"We had a very warm welcome at the check-in  and watched the crew setting up the cheese and wine tasting on board , while we waited to embark 

The Old Queen was a beautiful vintage wooden barge. The interior was immaculate and the cruise was beautiful 

The Gouda cheese boards were plentiful and the beer and delicious wine was flowing freely throughout the hour journey.  The merlot was lovely , as was the Chardonnay & Sauvignon Blanc ( we didn’t try the rose) 

The commentary was very interesting and humorous , as well as historically fascinating.  

Eva, Tiki & Karim were a great team who looked after us really well. Nothing was too much trouble and they genuinely love their jobs.  

The journey was simply stunning.  We went at 6 pm when the lights were all coming on.  It was so magical 

I have been on many tourist sightseeing trips but I would say this one was heads and shoulders above the rest & was worth every euro.

AFTER AWHILE HE ENGAGED HIS AUDIENCE IN PARTICIPATION BY THEIR REQUESTS.  NO MATTER WHAT SONG WAS REQUESTED, BRYAN WAS WELL PREPARED .HE RECEIVED MANY OVATIONS FROM THE REQUESTED SONGS.  ONE THING ABOUT BRYAN IS. THAT HE CONSTANTLY LOOKS AT HIS AUDIENCE WHILE PLAYING AND COMMUNICATES ACCORDINGLY.  HIS TEMPO IS STEADY AND ON BEAT AT ALL TIMES FOR HIS VIEWERS.  I WAS SORRY WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP; HE WAS BOOKED ONLY 2 HOURS.  IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE LAUNDROMAT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

Vi åkte en dag då det var ganska dålig sikt ut genom båtfönstren men det var ändå en trevlig upplevelse.

1046,1046,Canal Cruise Review,3,Joel B,1.0,"Henry and Freddie were great fun and very welcoming for guests. The cheese and drinks come at an extra cost of €10 which is worth paying for. 

I would challenge the 'tour guide' aspect of the package as its not what you'd expect. There was no real structure to the tour and guests had to ask what particular buildings represented or the history of them as opposed to the standard template of being told what's around you and that was a let down. 

The view from the boat also wasn't very good due to a plastic awning type of cover placed over the top of the boat. It was loose so guests were very cold and unclean so trying to spot landmarks or take photos was difficult 
Looking it other canal cruises, I'd opt for a different boat if I could re-book. But if you're relaxed about understanding the history of buildings on the canal and you fancy an hour having Dutch cheese a few glasses of wine then this is for you. ",2023-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Dear Valued Customer,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent canal cruise with Henry and Freddie. We appreciate your positive comments about their welcoming and fun demeanor, as well as your acknowledgment of the value in the additional €10 for cheese and drinks.

We regret to learn about your disappointment with the tour aspect and the view due to the plastic awning cover. Your feedback is crucial in helping us enhance our offerings. If you could kindly email us at customersupport@flagshipamsterdam.com with more details about your experience, we would appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns and work towards improvements.

1092,1092,Not Luxurious at all!,3,Shauna W,35.0,"This tour is called “ Luxury “. It is not. The boat is filled to the gills. And in winter the sides are covered in heavy plastic that you cannot see through. Once the boat gets going the plastic also steams up so there are no views. We were seated in the rear of the boat so we were able to open two of the windows coverings. Which helped we could see some of the sights. Also from the rear we could not hear the guides speaking. 
Cheese and wine was served but a little haphazardly due to the crowding. My advice would be to do a small boat tour and in winter look for glass windows. 
I hate giving bad reviews but this is my experience. 😔",,2023-12-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Dear Shauna,

1093,1093,Lavish decor,4,travelandmove,2.0,"The first thing that struck me was the interior.  The manager has an excellent eye for style and color.  
The beds are extremely comfortable (I believe they are new).   Noise level is about average for a motel constructed the same size.   Housekeeping works very hard and all of the front desk staff are very friendly.  Shout out to the Dhaka guy!  :)   They are very helpful and make you feel welcome.

So now, the pros and cons:

Pros:
-Competitive rates (join Wyndham Rewards)
-Very comfortable bed/pillows
-relatively low key/quiet inside
-(I skipped breakfast, can't rate that)
-elevator works
-Traffic noise isn't too bad, building is not directly on the Loop
-Towels were soft
-Shower is really good, strong flow and good shower curtain (nothing leaked- didn't have to push the floor mat around to soak up water lol)
-Motel smells good, even the elevators
-No cleaning odors (clorox and pine sol drive me nuts)
-The manager has a green thumb, there are healthy plants in many places

Cons:
-they don't allow switching rooms (my other motel does, so I'm here now)
I was across from another extended stay guest who, although the motel is quiet, kept going in and out of his room several times day and night- thus my request for them to move to move me to another room
-the washing machine mysteriously quit on me; front desk couldn't even get it going (it worked before I was there and after I gave up on it, I was told!)  Hopefully it was an isolated event

Note: 2nd floor seems a bit busier than the 3rd so if you're needing as much silence as possible, ask if there's a room available on the 3rd.

2nd floor has a washer/dryer/soda machine and the first floor has ice

I have another favorite motel in town but for the price, you cannot beat the comfort of Baymont's beds.

Mix these with wondering about the streets of the city and you'll be laughing. 

Jim and Mirna, the hosts, were pleasant, informative and rather funny. Ask Jim about his parent's marriage - good story. The sights from the closed top barge, despite the rain, were lovely. I went at 18.30, when it was dark bare in mind. I didn't purchase the wine and cheese upgrade did sample some cheese on the way off the boat.

1111,1111,A Con!,1,Alex K,1.0,"We bought tickets for the Flagship Cheese and Wine boat tour in April 2023 through Viator.
Arrived on time only to be told that we would not be able to get on to the boat, but would need to catch the one straight after. The guide issued us with wristbands, presumably to show we had pre purchased the cheese and wine on board. The boat left on time and there was no other covered boat to replace it. Once the boat had departed, the guide came over and told the remaining passengers (most of whom had not yet  bought tickets)  that there was an open top boat that was leaving imminently and we could join them, with free drinks. This made no sense as we had already purchased tickets that included cheese and wine.
We declined their offer as it was not a like for like experience and requested a refund which is currently pending. Very poor and would definitely not recommend to pre book!",2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-10-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s: Dear customer,

Our sincerest apologies for the unfortunate experience you had with the tour. What you described is far from the level of service we aim to provide, and we deeply regret any inconvenience you faced.

The situation you experienced, with the change in boat and the open-top boat offer, was not ideal and certainly did not meet your expectations. We understand your frustration, and we are committed to addressing these issues to ensure that situations like these do not occur in the future.

We also apologize for any inconvenience regarding the pending refund. Please contact us at customersupport@flagshipamsterdam.com so we can solve this problem. 

Once again, we are very sorry for the inconvenience you've faced. Your feedback is invaluable, so we appreciate for taking the time to share your thoughts.

1172,1172,Inadequate Consideration for Families with Young Children,1,Dream10740521381,3.0,"Traveling with a young child can present its challenges, and our recent experience highlighted some aspects that may not be suitable for families with small children.

During our trip on the 21st of October 2023 at 12.15 from Anne Frank museum, we encountered a situation that left us disappointed. After the trip ended, we found that the crew's handling of our situation lacked friendliness and understanding, particularly when it came to accommodating our 11-month-old baby, our stroller, and our dog.

To our dismay, the crew promptly removed our stroller and dog from the ship without prior notice or request. This left me inside the ship with our baby and a considerable amount of belongings from the stroller. The situation became even more challenging as I had to navigate the ship's stairs while carrying both our baby and the items from the stroller.

We believe that there was a missed opportunity for the crew to communicate with us and address our concerns more amicably. A simple conversation and a few minutes' grace would have made a significant difference in our experience.

Our intention in sharing this feedback is not to discredit the company but to suggest that they consider improving their customer service, especially for families with young children. A more child-friendly approach, along with better communication, would go a long way in ensuring a positive experience for all passengers.

While our personal experience left us disappointed, we hope that our feedback can contribute to the company's ongoing learning and growth, so that future families may have a more enjoyable and stress-free experience on their trips.",2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-10-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Customer s:  Hi there, 

We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us, and we deeply regret the challenges you faced during your trip with your young child, stroller, and dog. 

We genuinely apologize for the disappointment you encountered and for the less-than-accommodating response you received from our crew. Your feedback is invaluable as it highlights an area where we can improve our customer service, especially for families with young children. We missed an opportunity to create a more amicable experience, and for that, we're truly sorry. 

Your feedback serves as a reminder for us to continuously learn and grow. We will take your comments to heart and work towards enhancing our services to ensure a positive and stress-free experience for all passengers, particularly families with young children. 

For your unpleasant experience, we wish to offer you a full refund. Please get into contact with us via customersupport@flagshipamsterdam.com, to set your refund into motion and let us know about any further comments or questions you may have. 

Once again, thank you for sharing your insights with us, and we hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a much-improved experience in the future.

We chose this  one as we wanted some cover from bad weather (it rained so this was a good choice) and something  more than just a cruise on the water and we were not disappointed!
Bel, Helena and Vittoria were all lovely.  Our hosts were perfect  hosts, making  sure there was plenty  of cheese and serving  a choice of drinks, our glasses were kept topped up. The ladies were very knowledgeable and entertaining and we spend a fabulous  hour seeing some sights and hearing  about  the history  of Amsterdam.  
I would  definitely  recommend  this for any adults but please  note it really  is not a trip for children  as there is really  no room for moving  around  which is okay but just so you know. 👍🏻 ",2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Nov 2023-20240113T072002Z-001.zip,24 Nov 2023.xlsx,2023-10,"['Bel', 'Helena', 'Vittoria']",4.5,Luxury Canal Cruise Boat with Drinks and Cheese - Central Station,True,790,Positive,Response Not Needed

1407,1407,Amazing,5,ubaida a,0.0,"I had an absolutely incredible experience on the boat cruise ride in Amsterdam hosted by Sa and Jorris, with the skilled skipper Karim at the helm. This adventure was nothing short of amazing, earning a solid 5-star rating from me.

From the moment we stepped on board, Sa and Jorris greeted us with warm smiles and made us feel right at home. Their knowledge of the city and its history added a fascinating layer to the journey. They were attentive hosts, ensuring everyone's comfort and enjoyment throughout the entire cruise.

Karim, our skipper, navigated the picturesque canals of Amsterdam with ease and grace. His expertise behind the wheel gave us a smooth and delightful ride. We felt safe and in good hands throughout the trip.

The scenery was breathtaking as we glided through Amsterdam's iconic canals, passing by historic landmarks and charming neighborhoods. Sa and Jorris provided engaging commentary, sharing interesting stories and local insights that made the experience even more memorable.

To top it all off, the boat itself was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, providing the perfect setting for our adventure.

I can't thank Sa, Jorris, and Karim enough for this unforgettable boat cruise. If you're visiting Amsterdam and want to see the city from a unique perspective, this cruise is an absolute must. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic and enriching experience. Five stars all the way!

The boat itself was very comfy and well maintained, and the route through the canals was stunning. We started our cruise right as sunset began, so the first half was during sunset and the second half was just after dark with all the canal lights coming on. Highly recommend that time slot if you can swing it. Drinks were also very nice and reasonably priced.

Overall, my friends and I were shocked how affordable the trip was for such a great experience. We would have expected something like this to cost far more than a few girls in their early 20s could ever afford considering the quality of the tour.

2437,2437,Tour was just OK.  Would recommend open (no roof) boat,3,Tim H,0.0,"The canal tour was average.  We were taken through various canals in Amsterdam, served cheese, beer and wine.  The tour guides were friendly and shared some simple facts.
I chose this canal tour because it was covered (good if it rains), and it was highly rated.
Pros: friendly staff, included beer, wine and cheese
Cons: The covered boat blocked much of the view.  The seats faced inward, making it hard to see outside and uncomfortable to turn around.  Not enough information, facts, or history of what was around us.  
I've been on canal tours before, and my favorite are the ones where it is a guided tour filled with facts and history.  Plus, the best boats are the one's that are open and have you seated facing forward.  
This wasn't a bad tour, but in retrospect, I would have chosen a different company with a different boat.",,2023-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Sep 2023-20240113T071942Z-001.zip,06 Sept 2023.xlsx,2023-09,[],2.5,Evening Cruise - Central Station,False,834,Negative,Need to Respond

2524,2524,Great experience for a sunny day,5,amy,6.0,"We got on the boat and were greeted by lots of staff checking our tickets and advising us where to go. Upon the boat we were helped to get on, had very efficient drink service (berry mojito and aperol spritz were great!). Our tour guide and driver (Tico and Gert B) were fab, gave us a great tour — Tico also spoken Spanish for some women who didn’t understand English which was good. The boat is electric which is very quiet and peaceful. Seats comfy and not too many people. The weather was very hot and sunny with no cover but the breeze is very good. There were lots of soft drinks and alcohol with ice. 

On google the maps advice to you go to LOVERS boats stop but you just need to take a left and it’s the other side of the bridge. Also pay before you get to the boat because we saved €2-€3 a person. Drinks are much cheaper than in bars in Amsterdam which is a bonus too.

Their staff instructed us to wait for the boat outside Anne Frank's House, so we did. 10 minutes before the boat was due to depart, we noticed it was nowhere to be seen. So we asked a staff member nearby who told us that the boat actually left from somewhere else! We sprinted to get to the boat, and arrived 5 minutes before it was due to depart, however the boat had already left!! It left early despite seeing that there were 2 more ticket holders due to arrive! Due to our limited time in Amsterdam, this was the only opportunity we had to do a canal cruise and it was something we'd been looking forward to for a very long time. The staff couldn't do much but say sorry and refund our ticket. They agreed that it was bad the boat left early and we were told the wrong embarkation point, but that doesn't make it OK. This company is unreliable, unprofessional and clearly disorganised. There are plenty of other cruise companies that are way better.

I expected most of the information shared to be the same, but the second team was not engaging, didn't give enough lead up time for anyone to take pictures of popular sites, and a lot of the trip was left without any information about what we were seeing.

3746,3746,Hariko & Greti - lustige sehr informative Tour!,5,Ramona S,6.0,"Mein Partner überredete mich unsere geplante Rundfahrt mit Flagship zu machen. Andere einstündige Touren werden mit 16€ beworben, diese hier mit 20€. Wir konnten zwischen einem überdachten ohne ohne Dach Boot wählen. Mein Partner argumentierte damit, dass nur wenige Leute an Bord sind und es Getränke gibt sowie Sitzkissen.
Am Steg wurden wir auch direkt angequatscht, was ich immer nicht so mag, aber wir wollten die Tour ja schließlich machen. 🤷🏽‍♀️ es gibt keine Rabatte für Studenten, Behinderte oder Senioren, aber ich schlug für uns kostenlose Getränke raus, das fand ich wirklich mega!!
Ein Cocktail Aperol o.ä. Kostet an Board nämlich 9,50 extra, das Dosenbier 3.50€ und so weiter … die beiden Hariko und Greti waren wirklich super lieb. Der Skipper kommt direkt aus Amsterdam seiner Aussage nach, Greti studiert. Die beiden wechselten sich ab und dadurch wurde es wirklich locker und gesellig, sie beantworteten auch Fragen und hatten Witz und Charme dabei.
Eine wirklich schöne Tour auch mit so nebenbei Informationen über die Stadt! Die Tour führte an Sehenswürdigkeiten vorbei, für einen ersten Überblick ist das ganz gut.

Booking the tour was a breeze, thanks to their user-friendly platform. The highlight of the experience, was the exceptional team on board. Skipper Jeroen W and Host Vlad were not only skilled professionals but also incredibly friendly and funny. They went above and beyond to make our journey enjoyable

What set this tour apart was the amount of insider information about the city that Jeroen and Vlad shared with us. It felt like we were getting a unique and intimate look at the city's hidden gems and history. This personal touch made the experience truly unforgettable.

3881,3881,What an amazing experience!!!,5,Patryk B,1.0,"I’ll be honest with you - I booked the tour thinking that the main highlight of the cruise will be alcohol served on board. Well, again, life proved me wrong. I mean, the booze was still great! But I was caught off guard with the hospitality the boat crew welcomed us with. That’s all thanks to our host Annie - what an amazing tour guide she is! Initially planning to get tipsy from the very beginning, I spent an hour listening fascinated to the stories about the city she prepared for us. Frankly speaking, I don’t even like amsterdam that much, yet, somehow, she managed to raise my interest. In the end, I decided to stay relatively sober - well done! I really enjoyed it! 

Kudos to our captain Vince as well - the ride was super smooth - it’s so impressive how he managed to navigate such a big boat in such narrow canals. 
Guys, don’t loose time. Book this trip and hope for Annie to be your guide and Vince the captain. 
Thanks Annie and Vince - you’re absolute stars!!!
Cheers!

4420,4420,Cruise118 - Never again!,1,Jim H,1.0,"I have used Cruise118 before and they were fine, very keen to beet competitors and secure your deposit, however, as soon as you need help to amend a holiday - forget it - they see this as an opportunity to take financial advantage. Unfortunately what I thought was a reputable and fair company - goes out the window. I booked a cruise with them using Celebrity Cruises and BA for Christmas and New year 2023, unfortunately I found out very soon afterwards that I had cancer, as such need major surgery, inc plastic surgery and to be followed by radiotherapy. The nature of the operation/recovery means that I would not be able to make this cruise. I therefore contacted Cruise118 to see if I could transfer my £1,255 deposit to any later cruise. Initially I was assured that I could but would have admin costs with the cruise co, £75 pp, Cruise 118 £50 pp and approx 
 £167 with the flight provider. I would have happily accepted costs of approx £417 and rebooked a cruise for the following Christmas. Unfortunately the cost of the cruise was approx £3000 to £4000  more expensive than their competitors of which they blamed it on un released expected flight costs (£6000 for two economy flights from Heathrow to Miami - really!) Of course they wont break the costs down and also wont tell you how your initial deposit has been spent! I was told I could switch the deposit to any other cruise so I selected a Scandinavian cruise mid way through 2024. I had already priced this cruise up with their Sales team who where keen to beat their competitors as they do advertise a ""Best Price Guarantee"". The amount of deposit they then told me they could use was £300 less 2 x £75 admin charges therefore £150. However, they were not prepared to stand by the price already and quoted the cruise several hundred pounds more expensive. I have pointed this out and selected a third cruise which included a flight to utilise as much of the existing deposit. This was quoted but I was then told that I am not entitled to receive any of my deposit back and that what I was told previously was incorrect. They also expect me to pay additional fees of £50 pp for cancelling the holiday.
Within the policy it states that Cruise118 will do their utmost to transfer your holiday where necessary. Quite honestly Cruise118 have done their utmost to take financial advantage of my unfortunate position by either overpricing holidays (therefore abandoning their Best Price Guarantee) or changing their minds when having been challenged to keeping the deposit and encouraging you to cancel your booking.
Throughout this saga I have acted politely and asked for help to transfer by booking to an alternative holiday where I can best utilise my deposit but have received constantly delayed responses and no actual help. They blame and hide behind their suppliers T&C's who actually would be quite happy to amend the booking if asked.
Initially I spoke directly to Celebrity cruises who confirmed that they would personally be happy to change the booking albeit with an admin fee and I spoke directly to BA who also stated that under the circumstances would happily allow me to transfer the deposit to an alternative flight.
Thank you Cruise118 for your lack of empathy and customer service, in the future I am likely to have many cruises with my wife, of course I will never use your services again following this treatment and will only ever book directly with the cruise company and airline.
Cruise118, I hope you feel ashamed, you should do.

However, Philippa did an AMAZING job of keeping them all fairly quiet as the evening progressed and we travelled through the residential parts. With some incredible patience and people skills she managed to make sure they didn't get out of hand, whilst checking in on the rest of the group.

We arrived at the advertised place only to be told we had to go somewhere else. When we then arrived, I asked if there was a toilet on board and was answered with ‘you can get on this one if you like’ (there was already a boat waiting to leave as we were a little early. The Slovakian girl was more interested in messing around with her colleagues than helping me. When we got her attention back she said there wasn’t a toilet on board our boat but did we want to go on this one - again she was half talking to us half messing around with a colleague and then she said this is your boat here - we looked and it looked really tatty and not very nice at all so we said we’d get on this boat instead and she said too late it was leaving. So we ended up on this boat that looked nothing like the more luxury boat before and that was in the advertised photos. Very limited wine and beer available, some chunks of vac-packed cheese and we couldn’t hear the driver at all. There were so many more tours around that looked really nice so I’d recommend looking around and booking when you get there with a different company.",2023-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,2023-09-17 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Sep 2023-20240113T071942Z-001.zip,19 Sep 2023(1).xlsx,2023-09,[],1.0,Luxury Canal Cruise Boat with Drinks and Cheese - Anne Frank,False,1237,Negative,Need to Respond

We had made reservations which we slightly cheaper online but reservations were not necessary. If inclement weather go with another cruise line as Flagship only passes out umbrellas but the cushions and pillows would be wet. Other cruise lines have glass covers that are retractable. We enjoyed a mojito on the trip whereas other cruise lines looked like they didn't serve alcohol or only served beer and wine possibly. The other lines had the captain both guiding the boat and giving the tour.  We had 2 people. The guide also made the mixed drinks and served wine and beer.  At night was amazing with all the lights.

They told us many interesting and funny stories about Amsterdam and the Dutch culture.

I live in Amsterdam and I’ve been in many open boat canal cruises before, but it’s the first time I’m in a boat like this one. I would be hesitant to repeat, despite the great skipper and the assistant, because I want my guests to have the vest view of Amsterdam.

5026,5026,"Rain or Shine, we were prepared",5,Tom W.,46.0,"There are MANY canal boat tours in Amsterdam.  Do your research.  That said, we had a great time  with this tour operated by Flagship Amsterdam.  Location was great (Right in front of Central Station) Price was reasonable.  The price we had included wine and cheese.  Before you arrive, check out the weather.  The open boats are great if no rain is predicted and not to cold or hot.  The day we went, about half way through the tour, it poured.  Other boats were scrambling to get under a bridge or pass out umbrellas.  Since our boat had a roof, it did not disrupt our tour at all.  Most canal tours offer 24 hour cancellation, so again, check the weather but book in advance if you can.  We arrived early to the boat to ensure the best seats.  Not required, but we wanted to be sure.  As it turned out, it would not have been a problem had we showed up just in time.  Captain (Albert) and and both tour guides (TumeLo and Loisa) took turns providing details about Amsterdam, each from a different perspective.  Cheese and Wine were good.  They also provided soft drinks for those that did not want wine.",2023-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,2023-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,No Response,Sep 2023-20240113T071942Z-001.zip,24 Sep 2023.xlsx,2023-09,"['Albert', 'TumeLo', 'Loisa']",4.5,Luxury Canal Cruise Boat with Drinks and Cheese - Anne Frank,True,1106,Positive,Response Not Needed
